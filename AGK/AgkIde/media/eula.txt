(a) load the Software into and use it on a single computer which is under your control;

(b) transfer the Software from one computer to another provided it is used on only one computer at any one time;

The Owner shall have the right to impose reasonable conditions such as a reasonable fee for doing so. In order to ensure that you receive the appropriate information, you must first give the Owner sufficient details of your objectives and the other software concerned. Requests for the appropriate information should be made to the Owner through their support portal at this web address: http://www.thegamecreators.com/?m=contact

(a) any software tool or software product which can (or might) be used in order to create further games or other software products;
