Three options are available for the compilation process -

_text
The <i>Compile</i> button will only compile the program. This is useful for checking whether there are any syntax errors within your program:

_text
The <i>Run</i> button will launch the last compiled program. If you haven't made any changes to your program and want to launch it again select the <i>Run</i> option. The benefit of this is that your program does not need to be compiled again and can save time:

_text
Double click on <i>main.agc</i> and the code for this file will appear in the main editing area:

_image
ide_27.jpg

_text
The file named <i>setup.agc</i> will be automatically added to any new project. This file is used to set properties for your application when running on platforms that create a window, such as Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. Try opening the file:

_image
ide_31.jpg

_text
You can edit each of the fields within this source file to modify the window title, the width and height of the window and whether the application is to launch in full screen mode. For example, on Windows you may prefer your application to have a windows size of 1024 x 768, so you need to open setup.agc, edit the width line so it shows width=1024 and then edit the height line to height=768. The fullscreen value is 0 by default, meaning a window will be created, changing this to 1 will ensure your application uses full screen on Windows and Mac OS X.
