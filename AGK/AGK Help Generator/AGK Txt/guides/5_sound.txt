Overview

This guide provides an overview of loading and playing sound in AppGameKit Studio.

What formats are supported?

_text
AppGameKit Studio supports the Wave file format. No other formats are currently supported.

How do I load a sound?
_text
The command <i>LoadSound</i> allows you to load a sound. A sound can be loaded using the LoadSound command:

_tier1
LoadSound ( id, file )
id = LoadSound ( file )
_tier1

_tier2
void LoadSound ( UINT id, uString file );
UINT LoadSound ( uString file );
_tier2

_text
A sound file can be loaded by either assigning an ID number manually or having it provided to you automatically. The next step is to let AppGameKit Studio know which file you want to load e.g. "mySound.wav". Please note that ID numbers are unique for a command set. Therefore it's feasible to have a sound loaded with an ID number of 1 and a sprite with an ID of 1.

_text
Here's one approach to loading a sound. The command <i>LoadSound</i> is called, an ID number of 1 is specified and the file to load is "mySound.wav":

_tier1
LoadSound ( 1, "mySound.wav" )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadSound ( 1, "mySound.wav" );
_tier2

_text 
This alternative method demonstrates how a sound can be loaded with an automatically assigned ID number:

_tier1
sound = LoadSound ( "mySound.wav" )
_tier1

_tier2
sound = agk::LoadSound ( "mySound.wav" )
_tier2

_sheader
How can I play a sound?

_text
Once a sound has been loaded it can be played with the <i>PlaySound</i> command. Several variants of this command exist:

_tier1
PlaySound ( id )
playSound ( id, volume )
PlaySound ( id, volume, loop )
PlaySound ( id, volume, loop, priority )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::PlaySound ( UINT id, int vol = 100, int loop = 0, int priority = 0 );
_tier2

_text
The parameters for this command are as follows:

_listbegin
ID
volume
loop
priority
_listend

_text
The ID number refers to the ID of the sound you want to play. The volume is a value between 0 and 100. By default the volume is set at 100, which will result in the sound being played at the maximum volume. Reducing this to a lower value will result in a quieter sound. The loop parameter controls whether the sound will be looped. A value of 0 will only play the sound once, while a value of 1 will loop playback. The final parameter is used to control whether the sound has priority for playback over other sounds, by default this is 0, changing this to 1 will give this sound priority. The priority value is used in instances where multiple sounds are playing at once.

_text
The following lines of code demonstrate a sound being loaded with an ID of 1, and then the sound is played with a volume of 50 and set to loop:

_tier1
LoadSound ( 1, "mySound.wav" )
PlaySound ( 1, 50, 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadSound ( 1, "mySound.wav" );
agk::PlaySound ( 1, 50, 1 );
_tier2

_sheader
How do I stop a sound from playing?

_text
To stop a particular sound from playing call the <i>StopSound</i> command. This command only requires one parameter, and that is the ID number of the sound. This example shows a sound being loaded, played and then immediately stopped:

_tier1
LoadSound ( 1, "mySound.wav" )
PlaySound ( 1, 50, 1 )
StopSound ( 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadSound ( 1, "mySound.wav" );
agk::PlaySound ( 1, 50, 1 );
agk::StopSound ( 1 );
_tier2

_sheader
How do I delete a sound?

_text
It may be necessary to delete previously loaded sound and free up available memory. To delete a sound entity call the command <i>DeleteSound</i>:

_tier1
DeleteSound ( id )
_tier1

_tier2
void DeleteSound ( UINT id );
_tier2

_text
This command only requires the ID number of the sound you want to delete.

_text
Here's an example of loading a sound and then deleting it:

_tier1
LoadSound ( 1, "mySound.wav" )
DeleteSound ( 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadSound ( 1, "mySound.wav" );
agk::DeleteSound ( 1 );
_tier2
