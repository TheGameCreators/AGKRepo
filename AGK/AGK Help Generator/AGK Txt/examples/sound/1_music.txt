Playing music

Description
_text
In this example we're going to find out how to load and play a music file.

_image

_text
AppGameKit Studio supports the OGG format for music. This example will load and play a file named "music.ogg".

_sheader
Process
_text
The process involved is as follows:
_listbegin
load music
play it
_listend

_sheader
Loading music
_text
As with other resources music use ID numbers. These ID numbers are specifically for music files, so it's possible to have music loaded with an ID number of 1 and a sprite with an ID of 1. Just like with other resources it's possible to have an ID number assigned automatically or provide one yourself. Either approach works just as well.

_text
In order to load a music file we simply need to call the function LoadMusicOGG and pass in a string that refers to the OGG music file, and save the returned ID number:

_tier1
music = LoadMusicOGG ( "music.ogg" )
_tier1

_tier2
music = agk::LoadMusicOGG ( "music.ogg" );
_tier2

_text
After calling this our file "music.ogg" has been loaded into memory and is ready to be used. We can later refer to it through the ID number we have saved in the variable <i>music</i>.

_text
For the sake of comparison here's the alternative approach. In this example instead of being assigned an ID number we specify it with the first parameter:

_tier1
LoadMusicOGG ( 1, "music.ogg" )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadMusicOGG ( 1, "music.ogg" );
_tier2

Once music has been loaded it can be played with the <i>PlayMusic</i> command. Several variants of this command exist:

_tier1
PlayMusic ( id )
playMusic ( id, loop )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::PlayMusic ( UINT id, int loop = 1 );
_tier2

_text
The parameters for this command are as follows:

_listbegin
ID
loop

_listend

_text
The ID number refers to the ID of the music you want to play. The loop parameter controls whether the music will be looped. When this value is set to 0 the music track will play through once and then stop. When this value is set to 1 the playback will continually loop.

_text
To play and loop our previously loaded music this line is called:

_tier1
PlayMusicOGG ( 1, 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::PlayMusicOGG ( 1, 1 );
_tier2

_sheader
Main loop
_text
Our main loop doesn't need to take any action other than updating the screen with a call to <i>Sync</i>:

_tier1
do
    Sync ( )
loop
_tier1

_tier2
void app::Loop ( void )
{
    agk::Sync ( );
}
_tier2

Everything is now in place. Here's the final code for our program:

_tier1
backdrop = CreateSprite ( LoadImage ( "background1b.jpg" ) )
SetSpriteSize ( backdrop, 100, 100 )
<br>
LoadMusicOGG ( 1, "music.ogg" )
PlayMusicOGG ( 1, 1 )
<br>
do
    Sync ( )
loop
_tier1

_tier2
void app::Begin ( void )
{
    backdrop = agk::CreateSprite ( agk::LoadImage ( "background1b.jpg" ) );
    agk::SetSpriteSize ( backdrop, 100, 100 );
<br>
    agk::LoadMusicOGG ( 1, "music.ogg" );
    agk::PlayMusicOGG ( 1, 1 );
}
<br>
void app::Loop ( void )
{
    agk::Sync ( );
}
_tier2

Conclusion
_text
Loading and playing music is a process that can be handled with a minimal amount of code. Other functionality includes the ability to pause, resume, stop and delete music. It's also possible to set the volume of music using the command <i>SetMusicSystemVolumeOGG</i>. For more details on these commands please view the reference guide.
