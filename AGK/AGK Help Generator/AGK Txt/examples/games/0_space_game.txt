Description

_text
This example takes you through the process of creating a complete game within AppGameKit Studio. The game is set in space, in a randomly generated side scrolling level that is populated with dangerous aliens. The objective is to pilot your ship through the level, destroying as many aliens along the way, avoiding any obstacles and ensure you reach safety. Here's a screen shot of the final result:

Before going any further we would recommend playing the game and getting an understanding of its contents and some kind of general overview of what is happening.

Overview

_text
The game doesn't require a massive amount of source code, but in order to keep things easier to work with it has been split into multiple source files:

_listbegin
main.agc - entry point for the game
aliens.agc - deals with the aliens
level.agc - handles construction of the level
misc.agc - smaller tasks like updating the score
player.agc - controls the player
_listend

_text
Splitting source code in this manner can make navigating the project a lot easier and it's well worth doing, especially for large scale projects.

_sheader
Main.agc

_text
The code starts by making a call to a function named <i>Begin</i>, which can be found within main.agc. This function kicks things of by taking the following steps:

_listbegin
Setting a virtual resolution
Loading a background for the level
Creating a star field
Creating a level
Making a set of alien enemies
Creating the player entity
Setting up a batch of explosions
Making text to be displayed on screen for the score etc.
Loading music and sound
_listend

_text
After <i>Begin</i> has been called the main loop is set up. The main loop calls:

_listbegin
<i>HandleStart</i> - to deal with the main menu
<i>HandleGame</i> - sort out in game action
<i>HandleEnd</i> - show the game over screen
_listend

_sheader
Aliens.agc

_text
This file contains all the source code relating to the aliens within the game.

_text
When the game starts <i>CreateAliens</i> is called. It is responsible for loading images for the aliens and creating the aliens. A pool of 10 aliens are made and reused throughout the level.

_text
The function <i>CreateAlienExplosions</i> creates 5 explosions for use in the game. The reason behind using 5 explosions instead of 10 (to match the number of aliens) is simple - it reduces overheads and memory usage. The end result is that when an alien explodes a check is made to find an unused explosion from the pool of 5, if one is available it is selected and displayed on screen and then resets once it has finished. This leaves us with a maximum of 5 explosions at once on screen.

_text
<i>UpdateAliens</i> runs through the 10 aliens and positions them. It moves the alien sprites and their engines from right to left. Once an alien is out of the game view it gets repositioned off screen to the right.

_text
The next function <i>ResetAliens</i> will ensure that all the aliens are in position and have their initial properties set.

_text
The <i>ExplodeAlien</i> function gets called when a collision has taken place between a bullet from the player and an alien. At this point an available explosion is checked for from the pool of 5, and if one is available a large explosion is created at the position of the alien.

_text
<i>CheckBulletsWithAliens</i> runs through the 10 aliens and 10 bullets and performs a simple collision check to determine whether collisions have occurred. 

_sheader
Level.agc

_text
This file contains code to create the background, star field and the level. The level is randomly generated by placing blocks at the top and bottom of the screen, there's also a few positioned at locations near to the centre of the screen.

_sheader
Misc.agc

_text
Functions in this file are used to create text entities for the score display, updating these displays and loading music and sound effects.

_sheader
Player.agc

_text
Code relating to the player exists in this file.

_text
The function <i>CreatePlayer</i> loads an image for the player's ship and applies this to a sprite. This is followed with a call to <i>ResetPlayer</i> and <i>ResetBullets</i>.

_text
The <i>ResetPlayer</i> function is called by <i>CreatePlayer</i> and when the game restarts. It's a simple function that returns the player to its default state, by setting its position and creating a particle emitter to be used as an engine trail.

Conclusion

_text
Making this game turned out to be a fairly simple process in AppGameKit Studio and the major benefit is that it runs on multiple platforms without any alterations.
