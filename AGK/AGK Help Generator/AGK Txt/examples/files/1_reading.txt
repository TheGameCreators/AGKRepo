Reading from a file

_sheader
Description

_text
Games often need to store data on a file, for example, high scores or level progress. The file access commands in AppGameKit Studio provide the ability to deal with tasks such as this. In this particular example commands are used that show the opening and reading of data from a file.

_sheader
Overview

_text
The process involved is as follows:

_listbegin
open a file for reading
read data such as an integer, float and string
close the file
_listend

_sheader
Open a file for reading

_text
The command to open a file for writing is called <i>OpenToWrite</i>. It either takes one or two parameters dependant on usage. The first option is to have the command return an ID number for later usage, when taking this option the command only requires one parameter - the filename. If you want to specify an ID number then the command takes two parameters - the ID and the filename.

_text
This line of code shows the first option:

_tier1
fileID = OpenToRead ( "myfile.txt" )
_tier1

_tier2
fileID = agk::OpenToRead ( "myfile.txt" );
_tier2

_text
An ID for the file is returned to the variable <i>fileID</i>, the first parameter "myFile.txt" tells AppGameKit Studio that we want to open this particular file.

_text
The alternative approach is to specify an ID number manually, instead of it being assigned in the return value:

_tier1
OpenToRead ( 1, "myfile.txt" )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::OpenToRead ( 1, "myfile.txt" );
_tier2

_text
For the purpose of our example an ID number will be specified manually.

_sheader
Reading data from a file

_text
There are three possible data types that can be read from a file:

_listbegin
integers
strings
floats
_listend

_sheader
Test file
_text
Our test file will contain the following data:

_listbegin
10
1.23
hello
_listend

_sheader
Read an integer from a file

_text
To read an integer from file call the <i>ReadInteger</i> command. This command takes one parameter - the ID of the file. This line of code reads an integer from the file, in this case 10:

_tier1
value = ReadInteger ( 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
value = agk::ReadInteger ( 1 );
_tier2

_sheader
Reading a string from file

_text
To read a string from a file call the <i>ReadString</i> command. This command takes one parameter - the ID of the file. This line of code read the string "hello" from file 1:

_tier1
string$ = ReadString ( 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
string = agk::ReadString ( 1 );
_tier2

_sheader
Reading a float from file

_text
To read a float from a file call the <i>ReadFloat</i> command. This command takes one parameter - the ID of the file. This line of code reads the value 1.23 from file 1:

_tier1
value# = ReadFloat ( 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
value = agk::ReadFloat ( 1 );
_tier2


_sheader
Closing a file
_text
Once all data has been read from a file that file must be closed using the command <i>CloseFile</i>. This commands only parameter is the ID of the file. To close file 1:

_tier1
CloseFile ( 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::CloseFile ( 1 );
_tier2

_sheader
Full code listing
_text
Our final program will read from a file containing this data:

_listbegin
10
1.23
hello
_listend

_text
Here's the code:

_tier1
OpenToRead ( 1, "myfile.txt" )
<br>
a = ReadInteger ( 1 )
b# = ReadFloat ( 1 )
c$ = ReadString ( 1 )
<br>
CloseFile ( 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::OpenToRead ( 1, "myfile.txt" );
<br>
a = agk::ReadInteger ( 1 );
b = agk::ReadFloat ( 1 );
c = agk::ReadString ( 1 );
<br>
agk::CloseFile ( 1 );
_tier2

_sheader
Conclusion
_text
As you can see from the above code, opening a file and reading data from it is a simple process. The important point to note is that you must read data in the correct order. Our file had an integer, a float and then a string, so we had to read it in that order.
