Writing to a file

_sheader
Description

_text
There will likely be occasions when your game requires the ability to store data on file, this is where the file access commands in AppGameKit Studio come into play. Through the use of these commands it's possible to store data and read this back in.

_text
How to open a file and write data to it is demonstrated in this document.

_sheader
Overview

_text
The example program takes the following steps:

_listbegin
open a file for writing
write data such as an integer, float and string
close the file
_listend

_sheader
Open a file for writing

_text
The command to open a file for writing is called <i>OpenToWrite</i>. It either takes two or three parameters dependant on usage. The first option is to have the command return an ID number for later usage, when taking this option the command only requires two parameters - the filename and whether you want to append to it. If you want to specify an ID number then the command takes three parameters - the ID, the filename and whether you want to append to the file.

_text
This line of code shows the first option:

_tier1
fileID = OpenToWrite ( "myfile.txt", 0 )
_tier1

_tier2
fileID = agk::OpenToWrite ( "myfile.txt", 0 );
_tier2

_text
An ID for the file is returned to the variable <i>fileID</i>, the first parameter "myFile.txt" tells AppGameKit Studio that we want to open this particular file, while the final parameter tells AppGameKit Studio that we do not want to append to the file, therefore this will be a completely new and empty file. If this value was 1 anything that we later wrote to the file would be appended to the end.

_text
The alternative approach is to specify an ID number manually, instead of it being assigned in the return value:

_tier1
OpenToWrite ( 1, "myfile.txt", 0 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::OpenToWrite ( 1, "myfile.txt", 0 );
_tier2

_text
For the purpose of our example an ID number will be specified manually.

_sheader
Writing data to a file

_text
There are three possible data types that can be written to a file:

_listbegin
integers
strings
floats
_listend

_sheader
Writing an integer to file

_text
To write an integer to file call the <i>WriteInteger</i> command. This command takes two parameters - ID of the file and an integer. This line of code writes the value 10 to file 1

_tier1
WriteInteger ( 1, 10 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::WriteInteger ( 1, 10 );
_tier2

_text
Here's another example where 3 integer variables are written to file:

_tier1
a = 54
b = 99
c = 12
<br>
WriteInteger ( 1, a )
WriteInteger ( 1, b )
WriteInteger ( 1, c )
_tier1

_tier2
a = 54;
b = 99;
c = 12;
<br>
agk::WriteInteger ( 1, a );
agk::WriteInteger ( 1, b );
agk::WriteInteger ( 1, c );
_tier2

_sheader
Writing a string to file

_text
To write a string to file call the <i>WriteString</i> command. This command takes two parameters - ID of the file and a string. This line of code writes the string "hello" to file 1

_tier1
WriteString ( 1, "hello" )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::WriteString ( 1, "hello" );
_tier2

_text
Here's another example where 3 strings are written to file:

_tier1
a$ = "abc"
b$ = "def"
c$ = "ghi"
<br>
WriteString ( 1, a$ )
WriteString ( 1, b$ )
WriteString ( 1, c$ )
_tier1

_tier2
a = "abc";
b = "def;
c = "ghi";
<br>
agk::WriteString ( 1, a );
agk::WriteString ( 1, b );
agk::WriteString ( 1, c );
_tier2


_sheader
Writing a float to file

_text
To write a float to file call the <i>WriteFloat</i> command. This command takes two parameters - ID of the file and a float. This line of code writes the value 1.23 to file 1

_tier1
WriteFloat ( 1, 1.23 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::WriteFloat ( 1, 1.23 );
_tier2

_text
Here's another example where 3 floating point variables are written to file:

_tier1
a# = 1.85
b# = 22.39
c# = 4489.0012
<br>
WriteFloat ( 1, a# )
WriteFloat ( 1, b# )
WriteFloat ( 1, c# )
_tier1

_tier2
a = 1.85;
b = 22.39;
c = 4489.0012;
<br>
agk::WriteFloat ( 1, a );
agk::WriteFloat ( 1, b );
agk::WriteFloat ( 1, c );
_tier2

_sheader
Closing a file
_text
Once all data has been written to a file that file must be closed using the command <i>CloseFile</i>. This commands only parameter is the ID of the file. To close file 1:

_tier1
CloseFile ( 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::CloseFile ( 1 );
_tier2

_sheader
Full code listing
_text
Our final program will open a file for writing and write an integer, a float and a string:

_tier1
OpenToWrite ( 1, "myfile.txt", 0 )

WriteInteger ( 1, 10 )
WriteFloat ( 1, 1.23 )
WriteString ( 1, "hello" )

CloseFile ( 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::OpenToWrite ( 1, "myfile.txt", 0 );
<br>
agk::WriteInteger ( 1, 10 );
agk::WriteFloat ( 1, 1.23 );
agk::WriteString ( 1, "hello" );
<br>
agk::CloseFile ( 1 );
_tier2

_sheader
Conclusion
_text
As you can see from the above code, opening a file and writing data to it is a fairly simple process.
