Moving a player

_text
This example takes advantage of several features within AppGameKit Studio to demonstrate how to move a player in a game, it contains the following:

_listbegin
a football pitch
a player that can switch between standing and running animation frames
a virtual joystick that is used to move the player around
scrolling based on the movement of the player
_listend

_text
Here's what the program looks like when running:

Set up

_text
The initial set up code will deal with these tasks:

_listbegin
set a display aspect
load and create the pitch
load and create the player
add a virtual joystick
_listend

_sheader
Display aspect

_text
When using the default percentage based system it will be necessary to select a display aspect, which is responsible for controlling the ratio of the screen. An aspect of 4 / 3 is chosen, which is effectively the same as the iPad resolution of 1024 x 768. You can test this by checking the results of 4 / 3 and 1024 / 768 (both of these give a result of 1.333). Setting the display aspect to 4 / 3 will mean that our example will cover the whole screen on the iPad, as it has the same aspect ratio. Other platforms may have different aspect ratios, for example, the landscape iPhone resolution is 480 x 320 and when divided this gives us a result of 1.5, therefore when running this example on the iPhone there would be small black borders on screen to ensure the aspect ratio of 4 / 3 is enforced.

_tier1
SetDisplayAspect ( 4.0 / 3.0 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::SetDisplayAspect ( 4.0f / 3.0f );
_tier2

_sheader
Creating the pitch

_text
The pitch graphics are split into two with pitch_top.jpg containing the top half of the pitch:

_image
pitch_top.jpg

_text
<br>And pitch_bottom.jpg contains the bottom half of the pitch:

_image
pitch_bottom.jpg

_text
<br>The top half of the pitch is loaded and has its ID specified as 1. This sprite needs to cover the whole of the screen on the X axis so <i>SetSpriteSize</i> has 100% passed in for the X parameter. A value of -1 is used on the Y axis so that the correct height is automatically calculated based on the width.

_tier1
LoadImage     ( 1, "pitch_top.jpg" )
CreateSprite  ( 1, 1 )
SetSpriteSize ( 1, 100, -1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadImage     ( 1, "pitch_top.jpg" );
agk::CreateSprite  ( 1, 1 );
agk::SetSpriteSize ( 1, 100, -1 );	
_tier2

_text
A similar process is repeated for the bottom half of the pitch, except this time ID 2 is used for the pitch image and the sprite. The Y position is calculated based on the height of the top half of the pitch, which will result in the bottom half being placed directly under the top half.

_tier1
LoadImage     ( 2, "pitch_bottom.jpg" )
CreateSprite  ( 2, 2 )
SetSpriteSize ( 2, 100, -1 )
SetSpriteY    ( 2, GetSpriteHeight ( 1 ) )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadImage     ( 2, "pitch_bottom.jpg" );
agk::CreateSprite  ( 2, 2 );
agk::SetSpriteSize ( 2, 100, -1 );	
agk::SetSpriteY    ( 2, agk::GetSpriteHeight ( 1 ) );
_tier2

_sheader
The player

_text
The player sprite will utilise several images. The default standing image is named blue-standing.png and is shown here:

_image
blue-standing.png

_text
<br>To create the player sprite the following code is used:

_tier1
LoadImage         ( 3, "blue-standing.png" )
CreateSprite      ( 3, 3 )
SetSpriteSize     ( 3, 2.5, -1 )
SetSpritePosition ( 3, 50, 50 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadImage         ( 3, "blue-standing.png" );
agk::CreateSprite      ( 3, 3 );
agk::SetSpriteSize     ( 3, 2.5, -1 );	
agk::SetSpritePosition ( 3, 50, 50 );
_tier2

_text
The standing image is loaded into ID 3, then the sprite is created using an ID of 3, and its size set to 2.5% of the screen on the X axis with the size on Y axis being calculated automatically, finally the position is set to 50% on the X axis and 50% on the Y axis, which will place our player at the center of the screen.

_text
Several animation frames are available that can be used when the player starts running across the pitch:

_image
blue-running-1.png
_image
blue-running-2.png
_image
blue-running-3.png
_image
blue-running-4.png
_image
blue-running-5.png
_image
blue-running-6.png

_text
<br>These frames of animation are added by calling <i>AddSpriteAnimationFrame</i>:

_tier1
AddSpriteAnimationFrame ( 3, LoadImage ( "blue-running-1.png" ) )
AddSpriteAnimationFrame ( 3, LoadImage ( "blue-running-2.png" ) )
AddSpriteAnimationFrame ( 3, LoadImage ( "blue-running-3.png" ) )
AddSpriteAnimationFrame ( 3, LoadImage ( "blue-running-4.png" ) )
AddSpriteAnimationFrame ( 3, LoadImage ( "blue-running-5.png" ) )
AddSpriteAnimationFrame ( 3, LoadImage ( "blue-running-6.png" ) )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::AddSpriteAnimationFrame ( 3, agk::LoadImage ( "blue-running-1.png" ) );
agk::AddSpriteAnimationFrame ( 3, agk::LoadImage ( "blue-running-2.png" ) );
agk::AddSpriteAnimationFrame ( 3, agk::LoadImage ( "blue-running-3.png" ) );
agk::AddSpriteAnimationFrame ( 3, agk::LoadImage ( "blue-running-4.png" ) );
agk::AddSpriteAnimationFrame ( 3, agk::LoadImage ( "blue-running-5.png" ) );
agk::AddSpriteAnimationFrame ( 3, agk::LoadImage ( "blue-running-6.png" ) );
_tier2

_sheader
Adding a virtual joystick

_text
The player will be controlled by a virtual joystick, that will be placed on screen using the command <i>AddVirtualJoystick</i>:

_tier1
AddVirtualJoystick ( 1, 8, 90, 10 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::AddVirtualJoystick ( 1, 8, 90, 10 );
_tier2

_text
An ID of 1 is specified for the virtual joystick, it is positioned at 8% on the X axis and 90% on the Y axis, finally it is set to have dimensions of 10% by 10%.

_sheader
Main loop

_text
At this point all of our graphics are in place - the football pitch and the player with animations, there is also a virtual joystick that will be displayed on screen. The next step is to consider what needs to happen within our main loop:

_listbegin
we need to respond to input from the virtual joystick and move and animate our player
the view must also be scrolled as the player runs up and down the screen.
_listend

_text
To retrieve input from the virtual joystick the commands <i>GetVirtualJoystickX</i> and <i>GetVirtualJoystickY</i> are called. These commands return a value between -1 and 1 that indicate any movement that has been applied to the joystick. Once we know this input the player's rotation, position and animation can be updated. Here's the process:

_listbegin
obtain input from the virtual joystick
find the position of our player
subtract joystick input from our player's position to work out the direction of movement
calculate the angle which the player should be facing
update the position of the player based on the input
scroll the screen based on the input
when there is no joystick input show the standing animation frame
when there is joystick input play the running animation
_listend

_sheader
Obtaining input from the joystick

_text
The commands <i>GetVirtualJoystickX</i> and <i>GetVirtualJoystickY</i> return any input from the virtual joystick:

_tier1
joystickX# = GetVirtualJoystickX ( 1 )
joystickY# = GetVirtualJoystickY ( 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
float joystickX = agk::GetVirtualJoystickX ( 1 );
float joystickY = agk::GetVirtualJoystickY ( 1 );
_tier2

_sheader
Finding the position of our player

_text
The position of our player is obtained as follows:

_tier1
x# = GetSpriteX ( 3 )
y# = GetSpriteY ( 3 )
_tier1

_tier2
float x = agk::GetSpriteX ( 3 );
float y = agk::GetSpriteY ( 3 );
_tier2

_sheader
Direction

_text
Input from the joystick is subtracted from the player's position and stored:

_tier1
x1# = x# - joystickX#
y1# = y# - joystickY#
_tier1

_tier2
float x1 = x - joystickX;
float y1 = y - joystickY;
_tier2

_sheader
Calculating the angle

_text
At this point enough information is known so that the player's rotation can be updated, so that he is facing the correct direction. To achieve this a rotation angle is calculated based on the original location of the player and the direction it is moving in:

_tier1
angle# = ATanFull ( x1# - x#, y1# - y# )
<br>	
SetSpriteAngle ( 3, angle# )
_tier1

_tier2
float angle = agk::ATanFull ( x1 - x, y1 - y );
<br>	
agk::SetSpriteAngle ( 3, angle );
_tier2

_text
The command <i>ATanFull</i> returns the angle in degrees for the direction passed in. This is followed with a call to update the angle of the player sprite.

_sheader
Updating the player's position

_text
The next step is to update the position of our player by adding to its original position input data from the joystick:

_tier1
SetSpritePosition ( 3, GetSpriteX ( 3 ) + ( joystickX / 5.0 ), GetSpriteY ( 3 ) + ( joystickY / 5.0 ) )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::SetSpritePosition ( 3, agk::GetSpriteX ( 3 ) + ( joystickX / 5.0f ), agk::GetSpriteY ( 3 ) + ( joystickY / 5.0f ) );
_tier2

_text
The joystick input is divided by 5 before being applied to the player's position. This is done as a way of dampening the input and ensuring the player doesn't move around too fast. If no division occurred the player would race around the screen incredibly fast and if the division was higher e.g. 10 then the player would be very slow.

_sheader
Scrolling the screen

_text
The screen is scrolled by taking the position of the player and subtracting 50%, therefore the view will always be centered on the player. There is no scrolling required on the X axis as we only need to control movement on the Y axis. There is also no check so the player can run off the pitch:

_tier1
SetViewOffset ( 0.0, y# - 50 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::SetViewOffset ( 0.0f, y - 50 );
_tier2

_sheader
Animation

_text
The only task remaining is to deal with animation. When there is no input from the virtual joystick any animation is stopped and the player's image is set to the standing image (ID 3). Whenever input is received if the run animation is not already playing then it is triggered:

_tier1
if ( joystickX# = 0.0 and joystickY# = 0.0 )
    StopSprite ( 3 )
    SetSpriteFrame ( 3, 3 )
else
    if ( GetSpritePlaying ( 3 ) = 0 )
        PlaySprite ( 3, 10, 1, 2, 7 )
    endif
endif
_tier1

_tier2
if ( joystickX == 0.0f && joystickY == 0.0f )
{
    agk::StopSprite ( 3 );
    agk::SetSpriteFrame ( 3, 3 );
}
else
{
    if ( agk::GetSpritePlaying ( 3 ) == 0 )
        agk::PlaySprite ( 3, 10, 1, 2, 7 );
}
_tier2

Conclusion
_text
The input systems provided within AppGameKit Studio can be used to handle most forms of input and allow you to concentrate on writing your game. As seen from this example only a few lines of code are needed to get a virtual joystick on screen and move a player around the game.
