Error messages

_text
When something goes wrong in your program it may be necessary to show an error message or a warning. 

_text
This example demonstrates the available options when dealing with errors:

_listbegin
display an error
display a warning
set the error mode
_listend

_sheader
Display an error
_text
In the event that something doesn't quite behave as expected you can call the command <i>Error</i> to display an error message on screen:

_tier1
Error ( "something has broken" )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::Error ( "something has broken" );
_tier2

_sheader
Display a warning
_text
Warnings can be used when something may be amiss, but it's not quite critical to the running of the application. To display a warning use the command <i>Warning</i>. A warning will get displayed in the debug output of the IDE:

_tier1
Warning ( "missing some data" )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::Warning ( "missing some data" );
_tier2

_sheader
Setting the error mode
_text
When an error occurs, AppGameKit Studio can take one of three options - ignore it, report it and continue or report it and stop the program. This is controlled with the command <i>SetErrorMode</i>. The command takes one parameter with a value of 0 meaning errors are ignored, a value of 1 will report errors and allow the program to continue, and finally a value of 2 will report the error and then stop the program. The default value is 1. This line sets our program to ignore all errors:

_tier1
SetErrorMode ( 0 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::SetErrorMode ( 0 );
_tier2

Full code listing
_text
This code will display an error, then a warning, followed by the error mode being set to 0 (so errors are ignored) and then attempting to display another error which will not be shown:

_tier1
Error ( "something has broken" )
Warning ( "missing some data" )
<br>
SetErrorMode ( 0 )
<br>
Error ( "this error will not be shown" )
_tier1

_tier2
void app::Begin ( void )
{
    agk::Error ( "something has broken" );
    agk::Warning ( "missing some data" );
<br>
    agk::SetErrorMode ( 0 );
<br>
    agk::Error ( "this error will not be shown" );
}

Conclusion
_text
Not all applications will need to check for errors, but when it's necessary this extra care in your coding will be appreciated by your users.
