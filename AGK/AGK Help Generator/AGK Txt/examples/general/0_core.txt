Core commands and general program layout

_sheader
Description
_text
AppGameKit Studio has a set of core commands that deal with aspects such as finding out the width and height of a device, updating the screen, checking the orientation of a screen and finding out what device your application is running on. In this example we'll explore the usage of these commands and also look at a typical layout for an AppGameKit Studio program.

_sheader
General layout
_text
A typical AppGameKit Studio program will follow this process:

_listbegin
load resources such as images and sound
set up sprites to be displayed on screen
move to the main loop
within the main loop handle logic for the program and update the screen
after the main loop save any program settings and clear resources
_listend

_text
Here's the process laid out in code:

_tier1
` load resources
<br>
` create sprites
<br>
` set up a simple loop
do
    ` handle logic  
<br>
    ` update the screen
loop
<br>
` save any settings such as state of the game
<br>
` clear resources
_tier1

_tier2
void app::Begin ( void )
{
    // load resources
<br>
    // create sprites
}
<br>
void app::Loop ( void )
{
    // handle logic
<br>
    // update the screen
}
<br>
void app:End ( void )
{
    // save any settings such as state of the game
<br>
    // clear resources
}
_tier2

Core commands
_text
As mentioned previously the core commands within AppGameKit Studio allow you to retrieve information about the device and handle things such as updating the screen. In the code that follows we'll explore a few of these commands in practice.

_text
Our program will do the following:

_listbegin
find out the width of the device
find out the height of the device
retrieve the orientation of the device
get the name of the device
update the screen
_listend

_sheader
Width and height of a device
_text
To retrieve the width and height of the device our program runs on we call the commands <i>GetDeviceWidth</i> and <i>GetDeviceHeight</i>. These commands return these values to us and have no parameters:

_tier1
width = GetDeviceWidth ( )
height = GetDeviceHeight ( )
_tier1

_tier2
width = agk::GetDeviceWidth ( );
height = agk::GetDeviceHeight ( );
_tier2

_sheader
Orientation
_text
On some platforms the orientation of the screen will be of no particular interest, such as with Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. The reason for this is that we can expect the orientation to always be the same. On mobile devices this is not necessarily the case. Users may be holding the device in any one of 4 possible orientations e.g. portrait, portrait flipped, landscape and landscape flipped. Retrieving this is useful as it allows you to customise your game dependent on the current orientation. Finding the orientiation is achieved with a simple call to the command <i>GetOrientation</i>. This commands returns 1 for portrait, 2 for portrat flipped, 3 for landscape and 4 for landscape flipped. It has no parameters:

_tier1
orientation = GetOrientation ( )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::orientation = GetOrientation ( );
_tier2

_sheader
Device name
_text
There may be instances when it's necessary to determine what platform or device your program is running on. This is useful for cases when you may require some platform specific behaviour. To find out the platform your program is running on call the command <i>GetDeviceName</i>. This command returns a string that will contain one of the following:

_listbegin
Windows
iOS
Mac
Bada
_listend

_text
The command can be called like this:

_tier1
platform = GetDeviceName ( )
_tier1

_tier2
platform = agk::GetDeviceName ( );
_tier2

_sheader
Updating the screen

_text
AppGameKit Studio will not display anything on screen until the command <i>Sync</i> is called. To ensure the screen is updated call this command within your main loop.

Everything is now in place. Here's the final code for our program:

_tier1
width = GetDeviceWidth ( )
height = GetDeviceHeight ( )
<br>
orientation = GetOrientation ( )
<br>
platform$ = GetDeviceName ( )
<br>
do
    print ( width )
    print ( height )
    print ( orientation )
    print ( platform$ )
<br>
    Sync ( )
loop
_tier1

_tier2
void app::Begin ( void )
{
    width = agk::GetDeviceWidth ( );
    height = agk::GetDeviceHeight ( );
<br>
    orientation = agk::GetOrientation ( );
<br>
    platform = agk::GetDeviceName ( );
}
<br>
void app::Loop ( void )
{
    agk::Print ( width );
    agk::Print ( height );
    agk::Print ( orientation );
    agk::Print ( platform );
<br>
    agk::Sync ( );
}
_tier2

Conclusion
_text
Several other commands are included with the core section. Please refer to the reference guide for more details.
