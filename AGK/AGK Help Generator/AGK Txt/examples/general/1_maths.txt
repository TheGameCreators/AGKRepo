Mathematical commands

_sheader
Description
_text
A series of commands that deal with mathematical related functionality is included within AppGameKit Studio. These commands handle operations such as obtaining random numbers, square root, sine, cosine, tangent, rounding values and more. In this example several such commands are demonstrated.

_text
In this example we'll check out commands to do the following:

_listbegin
get a random number
round numbers
get the square root of a number
_listend

_sheader
Getting a random number
_text
There are three commands related to random numbers. These commands allow you to set a random seed (from which a random number is generated), obtain a random number and obtain a random number within a range. This example shows the process:

_tier1
SetRandomSeed ( 100 )
a = Random ( )
b = Random ( 1, 10 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::SetRandomSeed ( 100 );
a = agk::Random ( );
b = agk::Random ( 1, 10 );
_tier2

_text
The first call to <i>SetRandomSeed</i> passes in the value <i>100</i>. This is a seed that controls how our random numbers are generated.

_text
The second call stores a random value within the variable <i>a</i>. If we continued to call the <i>Random</i> command and stored all the values we might get a sequence like this: 56, 98, 44, 43, 75, 2. If we repeated the process the sequence would be the same. The reason behind this is related to our random seed being 100. When the seed value does not change, the same sequence of random numbers will be generated each time. By default AppGameKit Studio will set this seed to the current time on startup, resulting in the generation of a different sequence of numbers each time the <i>Random</i> function is called. So unless you require the same sequence each time there is no need to call the command <i>SetRandomSeed</i>.

_text
The third call to the command <i>Random</i> passes in two variables. This allows us to inform the <i>Random</i> command that we require a number within a range. In our example the minimum value is 1 and the maximum value is 10. Calling this command numerous times might result in a sequence like this: 5, 2, 9, 1, 6, 3, 7.

_sheader
Round numbers

_text
Another useful feature is the ability to take a floating point number and round it to the nearest number. For example, if you had the value 1.8 and called the <i>Round</i> command a value of 2 would be returned e.g.

_tier1
value = Round ( 1.8 )
_tier1

_tier2
value = agk::Round ( 1.8f );
_tier2

_text
Other options include the ability to round a number down or up. This is handled with the commands <i>Floor</i> and <i>Ceil</i>:

_tier1
a = Floor ( 1.8 )
b = Ceil ( 1.2 )
_tier1

_tier2
a = agk::Floor ( 1.8f );
b = agk::Ceil ( 1.2f );
_tier2

_text
In this example the variable <i>a</i> gets set to 1 as we're using the <i>Floor</i> command to round down. The variable <i>b</i> gets set to 2 as we're using the <i>Ceil</i> command to round up.

_sheader
Square root
_text
AppGameKit Studio also includes a command to determine the square root of a number. The square root is a value multiplied by itself that equals the number. Here's an example:

_tier1
value = sqrt ( 25 )
_tier1

_tier2
value = agk::Sqrt ( 25 );
_tier2

_text
The variable <i>value</i> would be set to 5 as this is the square root of 25 because 5 x 5 = 25.

Full code listing
_text
The final code listing for this example is:

_tier1
SetRandomSeed ( 100 )
a = Random ( )
b = Random ( 1, 10 )<br/>
value = Round ( 1.8 )
a1 = Floor ( 1.8 )
b1 = Ceil ( 1.2 )
value1 = sqrt ( 25 )<br/>
do
    Print ( a )
    Print ( b )
    Print ( value )
    Print ( a1 )
    Print ( b1 )
    Print ( value1 )
    Sync ( )
loop
_tier1

_tier2
void app::Begin ( void )
{
    agk::SetRandomSeed ( 100 );
    a = agk::Random ( );
    b = agk::Random ( 1, 10 );
    value = agk::Round ( 1.8f );<br/>
    a1 = agk::Floor ( 1.8f );
    b1 = agk::Ceil ( 1.2f );
    value1 = agk::sqrt ( 25f );
}
<br>
void app::Loop ( void )
{
    agk::Print ( a );
    agk::Print ( b );
    agk::Print ( value );
    agk::Print ( a1 );
    agk::Print ( b1 );
    agk::Print ( value1 );
    agk::Sync ( );
}
_tier2
