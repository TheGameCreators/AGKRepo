Animating sprites - part 2

_sheader
Description
_text
There are three options when it comes to animating a sprite. These are:

_listbegin
load a series of images and manually update the sprites image using timers
add a series of images to a sprite and use the command <i>PlaySprite</i> to handle animation
use a texture atlas (a series of animation frames on one image), call <i>SetSpriteAnimation</i> to hook up atlas to the system, then call <i>PlaySprite</i> to handle animation
_listend

_text
In this example we’re going to examine the third option and see how to use a texture atlas.

External media
_text
This example program relies on a single image named "mole.png". This single image contains all of our animation frames bundled together. Here's what it looks like:
_image
mole.png

_sheader
Overview
_text
The process involved is as follows:

_listbegin
load our animation image
create a sprite
apply animation information to our sprite
play our sprite animation
main loop where we update the contents of the screen
_listend

_sheader
Load our animation image
_text
The animation image we are using in this example has all of the individual frames contained in this one image. It is treated just like any other image when it comes to loading:

_tier1
LoadImage ( 1, "mole.png" )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadImage ( 1, "mole.png" );
_tier2

_text
If you examine this image in an image viewer you will notice how there are 11 individual mole frames. Later on we’ll tell AppGameKit Studio to only display one of these frames at a time.

_sheader
Create a sprite
_text
With our animation image already loaded it’s now time to create our sprite. An ID number of 1 is used for the sprite, followed by another 1 to indicate that this sprite uses image 1:

_tier1
CreateSprite ( 1, 1 )
SetSpritePosition ( 1, 125, 200 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::CreateSprite ( 1, 1 );
agk::SetSpritePosition ( 1, 125, 200 );
_tier2

_sheader
Apply animation information
_text
If you were to run the application at this point all of image 1 would be displayed. To ensure only specific frames are displayed we call the command <i>SetSpriteAnimation</i>. This has several parameters:
_listbegin
ID number of the sprite
how large each frame is on the X axis
how large each frame is on the Y axis
how many frames exist
_listend

_text
Our image has 11 frames of animation and each one is of dimensions 82 x 88, therefore the call to <i>SetSpriteAnimation</i> should be:

_tier1
SetSpriteAnimation ( 1, 82, 88, 11 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::SetSpriteAnimation ( 1, 82, 88, 11 );
_tier2

_text
After making this call AppGameKit Studio knows enough information about the texture atlas, and it can display each frame individually.

_sheader
Playing a sprite
_text
Our sprite now has a texture atlas attached to it, along with vital animation information and we’re now in a position to animate it. All it takes is a call to the command <i>PlaySprite</i>. This command has several parameters:

_listbegin
ID number for the sprite
how many frames per second should be displayed
whether the sprite is to loop or not
start frame for the animation
end frame for the animation
_listend

_text
For our example the ID number is 1, the frame rate is set to 10 (a higher value will make it play faster while a lower value will result in a slower animation), 1 is used to indicate the animation will loop, the start point gets set to frame 1 and finally the end frame is set to frame 11:

_tier1
PlaySprite ( 1, 10, 1, 1, 11 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::PlaySprite ( 1, 10, 1, 1, 11 );
_tier2

_text
After calling <i>PlaySprite</i> the sprite will continually animate until such time that we choose to stop it.

_sheader
Main loop
_text
At this point everything is set up and ready to launch. All that remains is for our main loop to update the screen by making a simple call to <i>Sync</i>, as shown here:

_tier1
do
    Sync ( )
loop
_tier1

_tier2
void app::Loop ( void )
{
    agk::Sync ( );
}
_tier2

Full code listing
_text
Everything is now in place. Here's the final code for our program:

_tier1
SetVirtualResolution ( 320, 480 )
<br>
CreateSprite ( LoadImage ( "background.jpg" ) )
<br>
LoadImage ( 1, "mole.png" )
<br>
CreateSprite ( 1, 1 )
SetSpritePosition ( 1, 125, 200 )
<br>
SetSpriteAnimation ( 1, 82, 88, 11 )
<br>
PlaySprite ( 1, 10, 1, 1, 11 )
<br>
do
    Sync ( )
loop
_tier1

_tier2
void app::Begin ( void )
{
    agk::SetVirtualResolution ( 320, 480 );
<br>
    agk::CreateSprite ( agk::LoadImage ( "background.jpg" ) );
<br>
    agk::LoadImage ( 1, "mole.png" );
<br>
    agk::CreateSprite ( 1, 1 );
    agk::SetSpritePosition ( 1, 125, 200 );
<br>
    agk::SetSpriteAnimation ( 1, 82, 88, 11 );
<br>
    agk::PlaySprite ( 1, 10, 1, 1, 11 );
}
<br>
void app::Loop ( void )
{
    agk::Sync ( );
}

Conclusion
_text
Animating sprites using a texture atlas can result in a minimal amount of code and be very efficient. For platforms where speed is of concern it’s advisable to use texture atlases.
