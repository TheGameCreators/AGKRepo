Moving sprites

_sheader
Description
_text
In this example we explore a very simple technique that allows us to gradually move a sprite from its initial location to the point where a user taps / clicks the screen.

_sheader
Overview
_text
The process involved is as follows:

_listbegin
load an image and create a sprite
_listend

_text
Within our main loop:

_listbegin
respond to user input
calculate the destination point of our sprite
turn on a flag to move our sprite
move the sprite to its destination point
_listend

_sheader
Load an image and create a sprite
_text
One image is going to be loaded and used for a sprite:

_tier1
image = LoadImage ( "lime.png" )
sprite = CreateSprite ( image )
_tier1

_tier2
image = agk::LoadImage ( "lime.png" );
sprite = agk::CreateSprite ( image );
_tier2

_sheader
Respond to input
_text
When the user touches or clicks on the screen we will do the following:

_listbegin
only respond if the sprite is not already moving to a location
save the position of our sprite
store the destination as the point where the user touched or clicked on the screen
work out the distance between the original position and the destination
set a flag that notifies our sprite it needs to move to the new location
_listend

_text
Basic touch or click input is handled through the use of three commands:

_listbegin
<i>GetPointerPressed</i>
<i>GetPointerX</i>
<i>GetPointerY</i>
_listend

_text
The command <i>GetPointerPressed</i> returns a value of 1 whenever the user has touched or clicked the screen. When this happens you can use <i>GetPointerX</i> and <i>GetPointerY</i> to determine the location of the input.

_text
Here’s the code for handling input and setting up a new location for the sprite:

_tier1
if GetPointerPressed ( ) = 1
    x = GetPointerX ( )
    y = GetPointerY ( )
<br>
    if ( move = 0 )
        originalX# = GetSpriteX ( sprite )
        originalY# = GetSpriteY ( sprite )
<br>   
        destinationX# = x
        destinationY# = y
        distanceX# = destinationX# - originalX#
        distanceY# = destinationY# - originalY#
        distanceFromAtoB# = sqrt ( ( distanceX# * distanceX# ) + ( distanceY# * distanceY# ) )
<br>
        if ( distanceFromAtoB# <> 0.0 )
            directionX# = distanceX# / distanceFromAtoB#
            directionY# = distanceY# / distanceFromAtoB#
        endif
    endif
endif
_tier1

_tier2
if ( agk::GetPointerPressed ( ) == 1 )
{
    x = agk::GetPointerX ( );
    y = agk::GetPointerY ( );
<br>
    if ( move = 0 )
    {
        originalX = agk::GetSpriteX ( sprite );
        originalY = agk::GetSpriteY ( sprite );
<br>   
        destinationX = x;
        destinationY = y;
        distanceX = destinationX - originalX;
        distanceY = destinationY - originalY;
        distanceFromAtoB = sqrt ( ( distanceX * distanceX ) + ( distanceY * distanceY ) );
<br>
        if ( distanceFromAtoB != 0.0f )
        {
            directionX = distanceX / distanceFromAtoB;
            directionY = distanceY / distanceFromAtoB;
        }
    }
}
_tier2


_sheader
Move the sprite to its destination point
_text
With the previous block of code we worked out a location for the sprite to move to and a flag was set to notify us of this change. Within the remainder of the main loop we need to check whether this flag is true, and if so update the position of our sprite, using the following process:

_listbegin
see whether the move value is greater than 0
determine where we need to move to based on the original location and the direction
update the position of our sprite
reset the move value once the sprite reaches its destination
_listend

_tier1
if ( move > 0 )
    newX# = originalX# + directionX# * move
    newY# = originalY# + directionY# * move
<br>
    if ( move < distanceFromAtoB# )
        move = move + 2
    else
        move = 0
    endif
<br>   
    SetSpritePosition ( sprite, newX#, newY# )
endif
_tier1

_tier2
if ( move > 0 )
{
    newX = originalX + directionX * move;
    newY = originalY + directionY * move;
<br>
    if ( move < distanceFromAtoB )
    {
        move = move + 2;
    }
    else
    {
        move = 0;
    }
<br>   
    agk::SetSpritePosition ( sprite, newX, newY );
}
_tier2

_text
The <i>move</i> variable is used as a way of saying how far we are along the line to our new destination. Initially it is 0, and after a user has touched / clicked the screen and the sprite starts moving, it gets incremented by 2 pixels each frame. Once it is greater than or equal to the distance value we know our sprite has reached its location.

Everything is now in place. Here's the final code for our program:

    Print ( "sprite to that location" )

    if GetPointerPressed ( ) = 1

        x = GetPointerX ( )
        y = GetPointerY ( )

        if ( move = 0 )

            distanceFromAtoB# = sqrt ( ( distanceX# * distanceX# ) + ( distanceY# * distanceY# ) )

Conclusion
_text
This concludes the example of moving a sprite from one point to another. It’s a very simple technique that can be used for sprites in your games.
