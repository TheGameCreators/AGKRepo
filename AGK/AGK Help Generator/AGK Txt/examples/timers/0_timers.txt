Using timers

_sheader 
Description

_text 
Timers are likely to play a key part in your games, for example, triggering events, countdowns and much more. In this example a sprite has its colour changed after a certain amount of time has passed.

Overview

_text
The process involved is as follows:

_listbegin
set a virtual resolution
load an image and create a sprite
store the current time
within our main loop, once four seconds have passed, change the colour of our sprite
_listend

_sheader
Store the current time

_text
AppGameKit Studio provides a function that tells you how many seconds have passed since the application was started. This command is called <i>GetSeconds</i> and it returns an integer. When more accuracy is required it's recommended to use the command <i>Timer ( )</i> that returns a floating point number. This number contains the seconds and fractions of a second that have passed since the application was started (accurate to milliseconds). For the purposes of our example we only require the number of seconds passed:

_tier1
initialTime = GetSeconds ( )
_tier1

_tier2
initialTime = agk::GetSeconds ( );
_tier2

_text
With the seconds stored within the variable <i>initialTime</i> we can proceed to the next step.

Main loop

_text
Once four seconds have passed our intention is to change the colour of our previously created sprite. This is easily handled by calling <i>GetSeconds</i> again and comparing it to the "initialTime" variable that was stored at the beginning of the application. If <i>GetSeconds</i> is 4 seconds greater than <i>initialTime</i> we can proceed to change the colour of our sprite. Here's the code for dealing with this:

_tier1
do
    if ( GetSeconds ( ) > initialTime + 4 )
        SetSpriteColor ( sprite, 0, 255, 0, 255 )
    endif
<br>
    sync ( )
loop
_tier1

_tier2
void app::Loop ( void )
{
    if ( agk::GetSeconds ( ) > initialTime + 4 )
    {
        agk::SetSpriteColor ( sprite, 0, 255, 0, 255 );
    }
}

Everything is now in place. Here's the final code for our program:

_tier1
SetVirtualResolution ( 320, 480 )
<br>
CreateSprite ( LoadImage ( "background6.jpg" ) )
<br>
image = LoadImage ( "button.png" )
sprite = CreateSprite ( image )
SetSpritePosition ( sprite, 100, 170 )
<br>
initialTime = GetSeconds ( )
<br>
SetPrintColor ( 0, 255, 0 )
<br>
do
    Print ( "After 4 seconds the button" )
    Print ( "will turn green" )
<br>
    if ( GetSeconds ( ) > initialTime + 4 )
        SetSpriteColor ( sprite, 0, 255, 0, 255 )
    endif
<br>
    Sync ( )

_tier2
void app::Begin ( void )
{
    agk::SetVirtualResolution ( 320, 480 );
<br>
    agk::CreateSprite ( agk::LoadImage ( "background6.jpg" ) );
<br>
    image = agk::LoadImage ( "button.png" );
    sprite = agk::CreateSprite ( image );
    agk::SetSpritePosition ( sprite, 100, 170 );
<br>
    initialTime = agk::GetSeconds ( );
<br>
    agk::SetPrintColor ( 0, 255, 0 );
}
<br>
void app::Loop ( void )
{
    agk::Print ( "After 4 seconds the button" );
    agk::Print ( "will turn green" );
<br>
    if ( agk::GetSeconds ( ) > initialTime + 4 )
    {
        agk::SetSpriteColor ( sprite, 0, 255, 0, 255 );
    }

    agk::Sync ( );
}
