Simple Physics Example

_sheader
Description
_text
By utilising the physics commands within AppGameKit Studio it's possible to greatly simplify complex tasks such as collision and physics based movement. Transforming sprites into physics based entities is covered in this example. It's a simple demonstration program that creates physics sprites every so often, sets some properties and leaves it to the physics engine to deal with movement and collision response.

Overview

_text
A few steps are carried out in this program:

_listbegin
add a background sprite
load an image to be used by our sprites
set some basic physics properties
within our main loop, every so often create a sprite and set some physics properties
_listend

_sheader
Background sprite

_text
First we'll load in a backdrop image and display it as a sprite with an alpha value of 40 so it's no so bright:

_tier1
backdrop = CreateSprite ( LoadImage ( "background1.jpg" ) )
SetSpriteColorAlpha ( backdrop, 40 )
_tier1

_tier2
int backdrop = agk::CreateSprite ( agk::LoadImage ( "background1.jpg" ) );
agk::SetSpriteColorAlpha ( backdrop, 40 );
_tier2

_sheader
Sprite image
_text
Before moving onto the main loop an image is loaded:

_tier1
LoadImage ( 2, "silver.png" )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadImage ( 2, "silver.png" );
_tier2

_text
This image is going to be used by all the sprites that get created within the main loop.

_sheader
Physics properties
_text
The final part before the main loop is to set the gravity vector for all physics based sprites. For this example, gravity is only required on the Y axis at a rate of 0.1 meters per second squared. This is handled with a call to <i>SetPhysicsGravity</i>:

_tier1
SetPhysicsGravity ( 0, 0.5 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::SetPhysicsGravity ( 0.0f, 0.5f );
_tier2

_text
When our sprites enter the scene they will constantly be affected by the gravity. Increasing the Y value will have the effect of pushing the sprites to the ground much faster.

_sheader
Main loop
_text
After every 75 cycles of the main loop the following will take place:
_listbegin
a sprite will be created and use the image that was loaded earlier
the sprite will be positioned near the top of the screen
physics will be turned on for the sprite with a call to <i>SetSpritePhysicsOn</i>, this function takes two parameters, the first is the ID number of the sprite, while the second parameter controls how the sprite responds within the simulator, whether it is a static entity, dynamic or kinematic
the sprite will be randomly sized
a box shape is then assigned to the sprite so it is represented within the simulation correctly
finally some properties are set such as an angular impulse, velocity, random colour for the sprite and its restitution
_listend

_sheader
Adjusting physics properties

_text
Our sprites will have an angular impulse applied along with a velocity and the setting of resitution upon creation. When an angular impulse gets applied to a sprite it will affect the rotation of the sprite. The reaction to an angular impulse is dependent on the size of our sprites. Larger sprites will rotate slower than smaller sprites given the same impulse.

_text
Velocity being applied to a sprite will have the effect of pushing a sprite towards a particular direction. Directly after our sprites have been created they will have a random velocity applied to them. This will have the effect of shooting our sprites out in random directions on the X and Y axis.

_text
Resitution controls how our sprites react upon collision. If two sprites collided and they had a low restitution they might come together and upon impact stop and lose all of their momentum, after that they might fall to the ground as they are affected by gravity. If these two sprites had a high restitution, upon impact they might go flying off in opposite directions.
