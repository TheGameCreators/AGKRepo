Joints - Part 2

_sheader
Description
_text
In the previous example (Joints - Part 1) we examined the usage of weld joints, where sprites can be attached to each other in a rigid manner. In this example we look at the revolute joint, which is a more complex joint that allows sprites to rotate around an anchor.

_sheader
Overview
_text
The process to create this example is as follows:

_listbegin
load images to be used by the sprites
create a static physics sprite (the crate)
create a dynamic physics sprite (the chip)
connect both together using a revolute joint
apply an impulse to move the dynamic sprite
_listend

_sheader
Loading images
_text
Two images are loaded, that can later be attached to the sprites:

_tier1
LoadImage ( 1, "green.png" )
LoadImage ( 2, "small_ball.png" )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadImage ( 1, "green.png" );
agk::LoadImage ( 2, "small_ball.png" );
_tier2

_sheader
Static sprite
_text
Sprite 1 gets created, it uses the crate image (ID 1), it gets placed near the top of the screen and is set to be a static physics object:

_tier1
CreateSprite ( 1, 1 )
SetSpritePosition ( 1, 150, 50 )
SetSpritePhysicsOn ( 1, 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::CreateSprite ( 1, 1 );
agk::SetSpritePosition ( 1, 150.0f, 50.0f );
agk::SetSpritePhysicsOn ( 1, 1 );
_tier2

_sheader
Dynamic sprite
_text
Sprite 2 gets created, it uses the ball image (ID 2), it gets placed directly below sprite 1 and is set to be a dynamic physics object, it also has its physics shape set to be a circle:

_tier1
CreateSprite ( 2, 2 )
SetSpritePosition ( 2, 150, 150 )
SetSpritePhysicsOn ( 2, 2 )
SetSpriteShape ( 2, 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::CreateSprite ( 2, 2 );
agk::SetSpritePosition ( 2, 150.0f, 150.0f );
agk::SetSpritePhysicsOn ( 2, 2 );
agk::SetSpriteShape ( 2, 1 );
_tier2

_sheader
Using a revolute joint
_text
A revolute joint connects two sprites and allows for rotation. Within our example the dynamic sprite will be connected to the static sprite using a revolute joint. This has the effect of allowing the dynamic sprite to rotate around the static sprite.

_text
To create a revolute joint call the <i>CreateRevoluteJoint</i> command. This command takes several parameters:

_listbegin
sprite A
sprite B
x
y
colConnected
_listend

_text
The first two parameters of this command refer to the sprites that are being joined together. The <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> parameters control the anchor point of the joint. The anchor point is responsible for controlling at which point the sprites can rotate around. The final parameter <i>ColConnected</i> sets if the two sprites will collide, 0=not, 1=they will.

_text
When our sprites are connected with the revolute joint the anchor is set to 182, 82:

_tier1
CreateRevoluteJoint ( 1, 2, 182, 82, 0 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::CreateRevoluteJoint ( 1, 2, 182.0f, 82.0f, 0 );
_tier2

_text
This means the anchor point, or point of rotation for these sprites is the centre of the static sprite. The end result is that our dynamic sprite could rotate all around the static sprite if it had enough force applied to it.

_sheader
Applying an impulse
_text
If at this point the example was launched, then the result would be two sprites on screen that are connected, but not moving. In order to bring our scene to life we'll need to apply an impulse to our dynamic sprite. This has the effect of pushing our dynamic sprite in a certain direction. By doing this we'll provide our sprite with some force and it will start moving within the limits of the revolute joint.

_text
The command <i>SetSpritePhysicsImpulse</i> takes several parameters:

_listbegin
sprite ID
x
y
x impulse
y impulse
_listend

_text
The <i>ID</i> refers to the ID of the sprite that you want to apply an impulse to. The <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> parameters refer to the location at which point the impulse will be applied. Finally the last two parameters <i>x impulse</i> and <i>y impulse</i> are responsible for the amount of impulse on each axis.

_text
For our example we're effectively wanting to give our dynamic sprite a push and help it on its way. Therefore an impulse is applied at the sprites position on the X axis:

_tier1
SetSpritePhysicsImpulse ( 2, 150, 150, 10000, 0 );
_tier1

_tier2
agk::SetSpritePhysicsImpulse ( 2, 150.0f, 150.0f, 10000.0f, 0.0f );
_tier2

_sheader
Physics debug mode
_text
The final part before moving onto the main loop is a call to the command <i>SetPhysicsDebugOn</i>. After calling this command overlays will be placed on our sprites, which will help us to understand how the physics simulation represents our sprites:

_tier1
SetPhysicsDebugOn ( )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::SetPhysicsDebugOn ( );
_tier2

_sheader
Main loop
_text
The only code required within our main loop is a call to <i>Sync</i> that will ensure the screen is updated. Nothing else needs to happen. We'll let the simulation play itself out and view the results on screen:

_tier1
do
    Sync ( )
loop
_tier1

_tier2
void app::Loop ( void )
{
    agk::Sync ( );
}
_tier2

Conclusion
_text
With a few simple lines of code it's been possible to create a relationship between two sprites, where one is able to rotate around another. Whilst this example is relatively simple, it should help in understanding how joints can be used to attach sprites together.
